# CAS
Customised Arch Setup


This is basic DE and Tools installation script. Necessary packages will be installed but you have to mannually change the themes in the settings.
This script was created taking into account that the user has already installed almost pure Arch.

**git** is mandatory

# Packages Installed:
   * xorg
   * yay
   * **Cinnamon** or/and **XFCE**
   * few more necessary tools...(Read the **ttpkg**, **xfce** and **cinnamon** file for precise information)
